# terraform-aws-eks-cluster [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-cluster.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-cluster) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-cluster.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-cluster/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision an [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) cluster on AWS.


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).









## Introduction

The module provisions the following resources:

- EKS cluster of master nodes that can be used together with the [terraform-aws-eks-workers](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-workers) module to create a full-blown cluster
- IAM Role to allow the cluster to access other AWS services
- Security Group which is used by EKS workers to connect to the cluster and kubelets and pods to receive communication from the cluster control plane (see [terraform-aws-eks-workers](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-workers))
- The module generates `kubeconfig` configuration to connect to the cluster using `kubectl`

## Usage
