## Introduction

The module provisions the following resources:

- EKS cluster of master nodes that can be used together with the [terraform-aws-eks-workers](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-workers),
  [terraform-aws-eks-node-group](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-node-group) and
  [terraform-aws-eks-fargate-profile](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-fargate-profile)
  modules to create a full-blown cluster
- IAM Role to allow the cluster to access other AWS services
- Optionally, the module creates and automatically applies an authentication ConfigMap (`aws-auth`) to allow the 
  worker nodes to join the cluster and to add additional users/roles/accounts. (This option is enabled
  by default, but has some caveats noted below. Set `apply_config_map_aws_auth` to `false` to avoid these issues.)

__NOTE:__ Release `2.0.0` (previously released as version `0.45.0`) contains some changes that 
could result in your existing EKS cluster being replaced (destroyed and recreated).
To prevent this, follow the instructions in the [v1 to v2 migration path](./docs/migration-v1-v2.md).

__NOTE:__ Every Terraform module that provisions an EKS cluster has faced the challenge that access to the cluster
is partly controlled by a resource inside the cluster, a ConfigMap called `aws-auth`. You need to be able to access
the cluster through the Kubernetes API to modify the ConfigMap, because 
[there is no AWS API for it](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/185). This presents
a problem: how do you authenticate to an API endpoint that you have not yet created?

We use the Terraform Kubernetes provider to access the cluster, and it uses the same underlying library
that `kubectl` uses, so configuration is very similar. However, every kind of configuration we have tried
has failed at some point.
- An authentication token can be retrieved using the `aws_eks_cluster_auth` data source. This works as
long as the token does not expire while Terraform is running, and the token is refreshed during the "plan"
phase before trying to refresh the state, and the token does not expire in the interval between
"plan" and "apply". Unfortunately, failures of all these types have been seen. Nevertheless,
this is the only method that is compatible with Terraform Cloud, so it is the default. It is the only
method we fully support until AWS [provides an API for managing `aws-auth`](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/185).
- After creating the EKS cluster, you can generate a `KUBECONFIG` file that configures access to it.
This works most of the time, but if the file was present and used as part of the configuration to create
the cluster, and then the file gets deleted (as would happen in a CI system like Terraform Cloud), Terraform
would not cause the file to be regenerated in time to use it to refresh Terraform's state and the "plan" phase will fail.
So any `KUBECONFIG` file has to be managed separately.
- An authentication token can be retrieved on demand by using the `exec` feature of the Kubernetes provider
to call `aws eks get-token`. This requires that the `aws` CLI be installed and available to Terraform and that it
has access to sufficient credentials to perform the authentication and is configured to use them. When those
conditions are met, this is the most reliable method, and the one Cloud Posse prefers to use. However, since 
it has these requirements that are not always easily met, it is not the default method and it is not 
fully supported. 

All of the above methods can face additional challenges when using `terraform import` to import
resources into the Terraform state. The `KUBECONFIG` file method is the only sure way to `import` resources, due to 
[Terraform limitations](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27934) on providers. You will need to create
the file, of course, but that is easily done with `aws eks update-kubeconfig`. Depending on the situation,
you may also be able to import resources by setting `-var apply_config_map_aws_auth=false` during import.

At the moment, the `exec` option appears to be the most reliable method, so we recommend using it if possible,
but because of the extra requirements it has, we use the data source as the default authentication method.

__Additional Note:__ All of the above methods require network connectivity between the host running the
`terraform` command and the EKS endpoint. If your EKS cluster does not have public access enabled, this means
you need to take extra steps, such as using a VPN to provide access to the private endpoint, or running
`terraform` on a host in the same VPC as the EKS cluster.

__Failure during `destroy`:__ If the cluster is destroyed (via Terraform or otherwise) before the Terraform resource
responsible for the `aws-auth` ConfigMap is destroyed, Terraform will get stuck trying to delete the ConfigMap, 
because it cannot contact the now destroyed cluster. This can show up as a `connection refused` error (usually
to `https://localhost/`). The easiest ways to handle this is either to add `-var apply_config_map_aws_auth=false` 
to the `destroy` command or to remove the ConfigMap (`...kubernetes_config_map.aws_auth[0]`) from the Terraform
state with `terraform state rm`.

__NOTE:__ We give you the `kubernetes_config_map_ignore_role_changes` option and default it to `true` for the following reasons:
- We provision the EKS cluster
- Then we wait for the cluster to become available (see `null_resource.wait_for_cluster` in [auth.tf](auth.tf)
- Then we provision the Kubernetes Auth ConfigMap to map and add additional roles/users/accounts to Kubernetes groups
- That is all we do in this module, but after that, we expect you to use [terraform-aws-eks-node-group](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-node-group)
to provision a managed Node Group
- Then EKS updates the Auth ConfigMap and adds worker roles to it (for the worker nodes to join the cluster)
- Since the ConfigMap is modified outside of Terraform state, Terraform wants to update it to to remove the worker roles EKS added
- If you update the ConfigMap without including the worker nodes that EKS added, you will disconnect them from the cluster

However, it is possible to get the worker node roles from the terraform-aws-eks-node-group via Terraform "remote state"
and include them with any other roles you want to add (example code to be published later), so we make
ignoring the role changes optional. (This is what we do for Cloud Posse clients.)
If you do not ignore changes then you will have no problem with making future intentional changes.

The downside of having `kubernetes_config_map_ignore_role_changes` set to true is that if you later want to make changes,
such as adding other IAM roles to Kubernetes groups, you cannot do so via Terraform, because the role changes are ignored.
Because of Terraform restrictions, you cannot simply change `kubernetes_config_map_ignore_role_changes` from `true`
to `false`, apply changes, and set it back to `true` again. Terraform does not allow the
"ignore" settings to be changed on a resource, so `kubernetes_config_map_ignore_role_changes` is implemented as
2 different resources, one with ignore settings and one without. If you want to switch from ignoring to not ignoring,
or vice versa, you must manually move the `aws_auth` resource in the terraform state. Change the setting of
`kubernetes_config_map_ignore_role_changes`, run `terraform plan`, and you will see that an `aws_auth` resource
is planned to be destroyed and another one is planned to be created. Use `terraform state mv` to move the destroyed
resource to the created resource "address", something like
```
terraform state mv 'module.eks_cluster.kubernetes_config_map.aws_auth_ignore_changes[0]' 'module.eks_cluster.kubernetes_config_map.aws_auth[0]'
```
Then run `terraform plan` again and you should see only your desired changes made "in place". After applying your
changes, if you want to set `kubernetes_config_map_ignore_role_changes` back to `true`, you will again need to use
`terraform state mv` to move the `auth-map` back to its old "address".

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.



For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).
